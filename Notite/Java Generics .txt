What is autoboxing in Java?
Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. For example, converting an int to an Integer, a double to a Double, and so on. If the conversion goes the other way, this is called unboxing.

-We should always declair a generic in a ArrayList<> otherwise we can leave code bugs

What is a raw type in Java?
A raw type is the name of a generic class or interface without any type arguments. For example, given the generic Box class: public class Box<T> { public void set(T t) { /* ... */ } // ... }

When to use raw type Java?
List<Integer> is a parameterized type of interface List<E> while List is a raw type of interface List<E>. Raw types can be useful when interfacing with non-generic legacy code.
...
This is because:
They are not expressive.
They lack type safety, and.
Problems are observed at run time and not at compile time.
