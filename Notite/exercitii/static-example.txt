/*
    Create a class called StaticTest with one INSTANCE VARIABLE "name" which is a string
    The class should also have a STATIC variable which counts the number of instances created 
  
    --> In constructor increment the static field because we want to count the number of instances created by that constructor
    
    Implement the following methods:
    
    - getName() - getter for the instance variable "name"
    - getNumOfInstances() - a method that return the static variable (as you may have guessed, the method needs to be static)

    Test code: 
    
    StaticTest firstInstance = new StaticTest("1st Instance");
    System.out.println(firstInstance.getName() + " is instance number " + StaticTest.getNumInstances());

    StaticTest secondInstance = new StaticTest("2nd instance");
    System.out.println(secondInstance.getName() + " is instance number " + StaticTest.getNumInstances())
